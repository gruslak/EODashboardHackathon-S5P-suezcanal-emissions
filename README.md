The python file can be opened in Jupyter Notebook

With this script, you are able to display the average NO2/SO2 emissions of the suez canal in a specific time-frame.
Upload the file in your jupyter notebook and just execute every line. Afterwards you should be able to create a graph with the emission data with the command: "main()".

This project is a part of the "Air Square" Team.
